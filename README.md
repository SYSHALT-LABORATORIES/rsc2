# rscÂ²

custom CLI DE for Server2003 with a kernel (partial-OS)

# The syscall.bat incident (1930)

very long story shortened: we were making a custom OS for 1930 with a ROM interpreter
and a custom compiler that made the RPGMaker files a garbled binary file

after the game failed miserably, we decided to make this a totally separated thing
