# rscÂ²

custom CLI DE for Server2003 with a kernel (partial-OS)

# The syscall.bat incident (1930)

very long story shortened: we were making a custom OS for 1930 with a ROM interpreter

and a custom compiler that made the RPGMaker files a garbled binary file

after the game failed miserably, we decided to make this a totally separated thing

# Compilation

please compile using "i686-mingw-w32-gcc file.c -o file.exe"

this is supposed to run in an x86 environment

if you want to make a port for x64 take note: **IT MIGHT NOT RUN CORRECTLY!**
